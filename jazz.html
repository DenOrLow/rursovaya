        <h2>History of Jazz</h2>
        <img class="image" src="img/jazz.jpg">
        <span>Jazz is a form of musical art that emerged in the early 20th century in the United States as a result of the synthesis of African and European cultures and subsequently became widespread. Jazz is an amazing music, live, constantly developing, which has absorbed the rhythmic genius of Africa, the treasures of the millennial art of drumming, ritual, ritual chants. Add the choral and solo singing of Baptist and Protestant churches - the opposite things merged together, giving the world an amazing art! The history of jazz is unusual, dynamic, filled with amazing events that have influenced the world music process. The origins of jazz lie in the traditions of African music. Its founders can be considered the peoples of the African continent. The slaves brought to the New World from Africa did not come from the same family, and they often did not understand each other. The need for interaction and communication led to the unification and creation of a single culture, including music. It is characterized by complex rhythms, dances with stomping, swatting. They, together with blues motifs, gave a new musical direction. The process of mixing African and European musical culture, which has undergone major changes, took place since the eighteenth century, and in the nineteenth led to the emergence of a new musical direction. Therefore, the world history of jazz is inseparable from the history of American jazz.</span>
